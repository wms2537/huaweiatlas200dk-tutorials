# Huawei Atlas200 Development Kit tutorials

## Introduction
The atlas200dk is ARM based, it runs a copy of ubuntu server in it. It is mainly used to accelerate AI tasks, so it is recommended to separate other backend tasks such as administration, database, etc to a separate backend server. Similar to other single board computers (SBC), the atlas200dk boots from a sd card.

The host machine needs Ubuntu1804 because [Mind Studio](https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/ascend/resources/tools/mindstudio/detail) only works on ubuntu at the time of writing this.

The atlas200dk does not have a wifi or bluetooth interface, so only possible connection is through LAN and type-c USB. Main input power is from the 12v barrel jack. An at least 36W power supply is required.

For more hardware specs, refer [here](https://e.huawei.com/en/products/cloud-computing-dc/atlas/atlas-200/).

## Peripherals
### Gigabit Ethernet
The Atlas 200 DK provides an external 10/100/1000M Base-T interface, using the RJ45 connector and connecting to a network with a common network cable.

### USB Type-C
The Atlas 200 DK provides a Type-C USB port that is compatible with USB 3.0 (SuperSpeed), USB 2.0 (HighSpeed), and USB 1.1 (FullSpeed) communication protocols. This port can be used only in device mode and does not support the master mode. It is used to connect to the debugging host for loading and debugging.

### MicroSD card slot
The Atlas 200 DK provides a MicroSD card port that supports SD 3.0 and is backward compatible with SD 2.0. You are advised to use a standard MicroSD card of SD 3.0. The minimum capacity is 8 GB and the maximum capacity is 2 TB.

### MIPI-CSI
The Atlas 200 DK has two MIPI-CSI interfaces, and the definitions of the two interfaces are the same.

#### UART
UART 0 is an 8-pin or 10-pin interface used for the default debugging serial port (console) of the Ascend 310. The baud rate is 115200 bit/s.
UART 1 is a 16-pin or 18-pin interface used for expansion and communication with other modules.
UART-Hi3559 has 38 TX pins and 40 RX pins, which are used for the MIPI-CSI interface to access the Hi3559 chip for debugging. The baud rate is 115200 bit/s.

#### SPI
This 4-wire SPI interface only support master mode.

#### I2C
Only I2C_2 can be used, I2C_1 is intra-board interface. Maximum rate is 400kHz.

#### GPIO
As output pins, GPIO0, GPIO1, and GPIO2 must be connected to external pull- up resistors to increase driving capabilities. It is recommended that the value of pull-up resistance is 1â€“10 kilohm.

### SD Card preparation
Get tools from [here](https://github.com/Huawei-Ascend/tools).

#### Make SD Card
Download files listed above and put them in a directory.
A SD Card reader is required for this process. If you do not have one, follow instructions [here](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/usermanual-A200dk_3000/atlas200dk_02_0012.html) to place a jumper on the atlas200dk to make it into a SD Card reader.
```sh
pip3 install pyyaml
sudo apt-get install -y qemu-user-static binfmt-support python3-yaml gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu # Install dependencies
sudo chmod 755 make_sd_card.py make_ubuntu_sd.sh ubuntu-18.04.5-server-arm64.iso # give required previliges to execute file
sudo python3 make_sd_card.py local /dev/sdb # change /dev/sdb to your sd card location, you can check with fdisk -l
```
In this process, the script will help you install other dependencies, it might prompt you to answer 'y'.

Wait about 10 minutes, `Make SD Card successfully!` means you successfully flashed the ubuntu server OS into the SD card. Plug it into the atlas200dk and you are ready to go.

### Connect to Atlas200dk
There are two main ways to connect, through the usb type-c and through RJ45 LAN cable.

#### Connecting through USB
Connect the board to your pc with a usb type-c cable. If you are using a VM, you may need to manually connect the device (Huawei Ethernet Gadget) to the VM. Once connected, run
```sh
ifconfig
```
You will get an output similar to this
```

```
The first one(ens33) is your internet connection, the last one(lo) is local network, the centre one(ens160u1) is the atlas200dk. As you can see, it haven't got an IP address assigned to it, so we will assign one to it. To do this, we have to modify netplan. 

Modify `/etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml` as below with your favourite text editor. Note that .yaml files are indent-sensitive.
```yaml
# Let NetworkManager manage all devices on this system
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: NetworkManager
  ethernets:
     ens160u1: # replace with your network adapter name
       dhcp4: no # close dchp4
       addresses: [192.168.1.223/8] # Setup IP address and mask for device
       gateway4: 255.255.255.0 #è®¾ç½®ç½‘å…³
       nameservers:
         addresses: [114.114.114.114]
```
and then execute
```
sudo netplan apply
```
Run `ifconfig` again and you will see an IP address assigned to the atlas200dk.
```

```
Now, you have successfully established a connection to the atlas200dk. Next, we need to ssh into the board to do some initial setup. Default password is `Mind@123`
```sh
ssh HwHiAiUser@192.168.1.2
```
Here, we need to add the path of `libascendcl.so` into `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/mind_so.conf`.
```sh
su root
echo "/home/HwHiAiUser/Ascend/acllib/lib64/libascendcl.so" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/mind_so.conf
ldconfig
exit
```
Then, we need to restart the `ada` service. Run
```sh
ps -ef | grep ada
```
and run (replace `<process id>` with the id of the first process in output of above command.)
```sh
kill <process id>
```
Then, restart the process with
```
/var/ada
```
Congratulations, you have completed hardware setup. Now, let's try a demo project.

### Demo project 1 (ResNet50 Classification)
To start MindStudio, run
```sh
sh ./MindStudio-ubuntu/bin/MindStudio.sh
```
Select `Create New Project` or `File -> New -> Project` if you have opened other projects before.

Select Ascend App on the left menu. Here, enter details of your project or leave it as it is. Click `Next`.

Select `Sample ResNet-50` and click `Finish`. Lets see what is in the sample project.

Now, we need to download the model definitions and weights.
```sh
mkdir caffe_model && cd caffe_model
wget https://obs-model-ascend.obs.cn-east-2.myhuaweicloud.com/resnet50/resnet50.caffemodel
wget https://obs-model-ascend.obs.cn-east-2.myhuaweicloud.com/resnet50/resnet50.prototxt
```
Now, we need to convert the caffe models to `.om` format for the atlas200dk. On the top menu bar, select `Ascend -> Model Converter` and enter the file path. Other parameters will be loaded automatically based on the model file.

Choose `FP16` for data type and click `Next`. Data preprocessing is not required in this demo, so you can disable it be switching the slider. For the advanced options, we will leave it as it is for this demo. Click `Finish`. The output tab below will print out some logs. 
```sh
2020-12-21 00:20:17  Model converted successfully.
``` 
Something similar to this means a successful conversion. Now, we need to add the model into our project.

Right click your project name, `MyApp` in my case on the left menu and select `Add Model`. The converted model can be found in `$HOME/modelzoo`, which is `$HOME/modelzoo/resnet50/device/resnet50.om` for my case. Select the model file and click `Ok`. You can see the model file in the `model` directory in your project directory now.

Next, we need to convert the two input images located in the `data` directory into .bin format and resize it. The script `transferPic.py` in the `script` directory will do this for us.

Open a terminal in the `data` directory and run
```sh
python3.7.5 ../script/transferPic.py
```
After this, you will see two `.bin` files created in the `data` directory.

Now, its time to build the project. Go to `Build -> Build Configurations` in the top menu. Change the Target Architecture to `aarch64`. Then, click `Build`.

After building, you will see a `main` file generated in the `out` directory.

Next, connect the atlas200dk to MindStudio. Please make sure you have already setup Netplan and can successfully ssh into the board.

In the top menu, select `Ascend -> Device Manager`. Click the plus button on the top-right side of the popup window. Key in the IP address of the atlas200dk, which is `192.168.1.2` by default and click `Ok`. Now, you should see your device connected.

Click `Ok` to exit device manager. Then, select `Run -> Run 'MyApp'` to execute the project on the atlas200dk. A window will popup to confirm the configurations, click `Ok`. You can also run by clicking the green play button on the top menu.

You will get an output similar to this
```sh
